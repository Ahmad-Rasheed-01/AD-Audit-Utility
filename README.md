- Ensure running as Administrator
- Verify domain admin or equivalent privileges
- Check network connectivity to domain controllers

**"Module Not Found" Errors**:
- Install Active Directory PowerShell module
- Verify RSAT tools installation

**Performance Issues**:
- Large environments may require extended execution time
- Consider running during off-peak hours
- Monitor domain controller performance during execution
